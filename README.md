# My Secret Scriptures

Built with: Node.js, Express, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose

A full-fledged journaling web application that features a user cabinet built with Passport.js local and Google Strategies. It allows performing all CRUD operations, such as creating a journal entry, reading, updating, and deleting it. The data is stored in MongoDB, and the entries are protected and accessible only to their owner.

Each journaling section features unique prompts pulled from a local JSON file. The prompts are stored under different categories, and depending on which section of the journal a user is in, they will be able to generate prompts under a corresponding category.

There are four different background sounds that a user can play while being in editor mode.

Feel free to check out the app (deployed with Render free tire so first time you load it might take up to a minute), and use it, any feedback is welcomed:
